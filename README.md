# Some custom VR artifacts
Repo containing custom vr artifacts to import into a VR server using the Server.Import.ArtifactExchange artifact. Used these in a few IR engagements in the past and never know when I'll need em again.

* webshells (IIS, Exchange, Apache, Nginx)
* eql2vql - Sysmon detections from https://github.com/Velocidex/eql2vql/blob/main/examples/Windows.Sysmon.Detection.yaml
